# Recursion-TOP
This is a project from The Odin Project that covers recursion. The first part is a recursion assignment and the second is a merge assignment.

First Assignment (recursion): 
1) 'Using iteration, write a function "fibs" which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.'
2) 'Now write another method "fibsRec" which solves the same problem recursively.'

Second Assignment (merge):
1) 'Build a function "mergeSort" that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.'
